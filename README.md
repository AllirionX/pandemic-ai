# pandemic-ai
The project aims to create self learning artificial intelligence capable to beat the board game Pandemic.
As i know nothing about neural network and deep learning, I will start from scratch : no library will be used to manage neural network.

The steps
I Building a decent Pandemic Board game
1. Initializing the game (create architecture classes, useful methods) is its simplest way : no event card, no character player
2. Add log4j and comment this code
3. Build the game engine : waiting for input to perform player actions and automatically performing game actions
4. Build an interface to play pandemic and check everything runs smoothly

II Build a Monte Carlo Tree Search based AI and check if it works

III Build a neural network learning from the Monte Carlo Tree Search, Alphagozero's way
